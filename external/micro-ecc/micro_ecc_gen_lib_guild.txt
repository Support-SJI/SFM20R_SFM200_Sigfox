Software backend (micro-ecc)
micro-ecc is an open source library that performs cryptographic operations. It is optimized for small program size while maintaining high processing speed. The micro-ecc backend supports all current nRF5 Series devices.

When using micro-ecc, you must ensure compliance with the license of the library as stated in the LICENSE.txt file that is included in micro-ecc.

The cryptography library expects to find the compiled micro-ecc library in InstallFolder\external\micro-ecc\micro-ecc.

To install micro-ecc, complete the following steps:

Install version 4.9-2015-q3-update of the GCC compiler toolchain for ARM. You can use ARM's Launchpad to find the toolchain for your operating system.
Make sure that make is installed (see, for example, MinGW, GNU Make, or Xcode).
Clone the micro-ecc GitHub repository into InstallFolder\external\micro-ecc\micro-ecc.
Enter the subdirectory for the SoC and the toolchain that you are using to build your application:
InstallFolder\external\micro-ecc\nrf52_keil\armgcc
InstallFolder\external\micro-ecc\nrf52_iar\armgcc
InstallFolder\external\micro-ecc\nrf52_armgcc\armgcc
Run make to compile the micro-ecc library.

-> nrf52832는 FPU를 지원하므로 nrf52hf_armgcc, nrf52hf_keil을 사용한다.
